dots
====
These are my dotfiles. They are deployed by
[smlss](https://git.smlavine.com/smlss).

All dotfiles are located in the ```src/``` directory, organized as if
they were in ```$HOME```.

To install the dotfiles to their proper places, simply run ```make```.

The files
[nvim/ftdetect/gcode.vim](https://git.smlavine.com/?p=smlss/dots;a=blob;f=nvim/ftdetect/gcode.vim;hb=HEAD)
and
[nvim/syntax/gcode.vim](https://git.smlavine.com/?p=smlss/dots;a=blob;f=nvim/syntax/gcode.vim;hb=HEAD)
were originally written by
[Dave Eno](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4910) and
improved by [wilriker](https://github.com/wilriker/gcode.vim). I cannot find
an explicit license with the distribution of these files, but considering their
rather specific use case and that they seem to have been posted online in the
sharing spirit, I do not feel uncomfortable incorporating them here.

The file
[nvim/init.vim](https://git.smlavine.com/?p=smlss/dots;a=blob;f=nvim/init.vim;hb=HEAD)

StackOverflow. Therefore, it is licensed under the terms of
