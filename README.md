dots

These are my dotfiles. They are deployed by
[smlss](https://sr.ht/~smlavine/smlss).

All dotfiles are located in the `src/` directory, organized as if
they were in `$HOME`.

To install the dotfiles to their proper places, simply run `make` or
`make install`.

To uninstall the dotfiles, run `make uninstall`.

The files
[nvim/ftdetect/gcode.vim](https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/dots/tree/master/item/src/.config/nvim/ftdetect/gcode.vim)
and
[nvim/syntax/gcode.vim](https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/dots/tree/master/item/src/.config/nvim/syntax/gcode.vim)
were originally written by
[Dave Eno](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4910) and
improved by [wilriker](https://github.com/wilriker/gcode.vim). I cannot
find an explicit license with the distribution of these files, but
considering their rather specific use case and that they seem to have
been posted online in the sharing spirit, I do not feel uncomfortable
incorporating them here.

The file
[nvim/init.vim](https://git.sr.ht/~smlavine/dots/tree/master/item/src/.config/nvim/init.vim)
